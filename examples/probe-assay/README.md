Here is a series of ipython notebooks that walks you through simulation and analysis of experimental binding data using a fluorescent probe compound that increases fluorescence upon binding to its target protein.

 - `MLE fit for two component binding - simulated and real data.ipynb`
 - `Simulating Experimental Fluorescence Binding Data.ipynb`
 - `Bayesian fit txt file - SrcBosutinib.ipynb`
 - `Bayesian fit xml file - SrcGefitinib.ipynb`

To plot raw data using `xml2png` navigate into the data folder and run:
 > xml2png --type singlet_384 *.xml
