-`modelling-CompetitiveBinding-FluorescenceBindingAssay.ipynb` - Predicting binding curves and fluorescence signal for competitive binding experiment of one fluorescent and one non-fluorescent ligand using standart experimental assumptions (no ligand depletion). HSA - dansyl amide - phenylbutazone is used as an example.

-`modelling-CompetitiveBinding-AnalyticalSolution.ipynb` - Exact solution to 2 ligand competition equilibrium expressions is used to predict saturation curves and fluorescence signal. HSA - dansyl amide - phenylbutazone is used as an example.

-`competition-assay-modeling.ipynb` - A notebook exploring how concentrations of a competitive ligand effect the fluorescence signal. This will be replaced.
