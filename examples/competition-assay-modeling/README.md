Modeling of competition binding assays
======================================

## Manifest
* 'modelling-CompetitiveBinding-FluorescenceBindingAssay.ipynb' - Predicting binding curves and fluorescence signal for competitive binding experiment of one fluorescent and one non-fluorescent ligand. HSA - dansyl amide - phenylbutazone is used as an example.
