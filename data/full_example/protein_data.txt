# Jan 15, 2016 - Competition assay

Used eppendorf tubes of 2.81 mg/mL Abl D382N  from the -80 C. Spun it down and measured concentration (2.81 mg/mL)  with denovix (Using values for Abl D382N: MW 33,273.1 Da, epsilon 62340 M^-1 cm^-1)

Added 165.8 uL of Abl D382N  to 14 mL Kinase Buffer (1 uM of Abl)


# March 11, 2016 - Spectra assay

Used eppendorf tubes of 2.8 mg/mL Abl (D382N)  from the -80 C. Spun it down and measured concentration (2.8 mg/mL)with denovix (Using values for Abl (D382N): MW 41,293.2 Da, epsilon 49850 M^-1 cm^-1)

Added 166.4  uL of  Abl (D382N)  to 14 mL Kinase Buffer at room temperature (recently prepared buffer on 02262016).

# Relevant to both:

100 uL of protein was transferred to the 96-well plates using the Liquid LiHa using single pipetting on the EVO 200.
