assaytools
==========

*Assay modeling and Bayesian analysis made easy.*

AssayTools is a python library that allows users to model automated assays and analyze assay data using powerful Bayesian techniques that allow complete characterization of the uncertainty in fit models.

See the [examples](https://github.com/choderalab/assaytools/tree/master/examples).

**WARNING: This is a very early experimental pre-release in development. Use at your own risk!**
